# js-unit-test-examples
Examples of good and bad unit tests.

## Intent

We've experienced some problematic patterns in tests. This repo exists to highlight these patterns in an easy-to-read format. Hopefully we can persuade others to consider these problematic patterns and adapt accordingly.

## Dev: getting started

```
npm install
```

- `npm run test:mocha` for mocha-based unit tests
- `npm run test:jest` for jest-based unit tests

### Prereqs:
- node 12+
- npm 7+ (look for the v2 lockfile)

### VSCode plugins:
- dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
